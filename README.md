Can find Route numbers from paperwork using OCR. 

This is my first public repository so I don't know if I am doing this correctly.
But you will need to install the packages found in the python Script yourself. 

Also the script is made for route numbers 8 in length and store numbers 4 in length.

I'd be suprised if anyone in the world finds this little python script useful as it's
kind of specific to my working circumstances. But since I made it in my own time as project 
of sorts I figured I'd put it on Github for anyone else to use.
